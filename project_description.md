# Focus Friday Project Description

## Overview
Your task is to design a game for a middle school focus day. This project involves all of the components of computational thinking: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm design. You will have different due dates for different components to help you stay on track. The goal is for you to complete this in class. That said, particularly complex games may require more time. Likewise, failure to use class time efficiently may also result in the need to work at home. 

You may choose the Focus Day, and more than one person can choose a certain day.  Please read the list of focus days and the rubric carefully (below).

## Required components
This project involves multiple stages and submissions. 
### Stage 1: Decomposition

The first step is to break down the problem. What are you trying to accomplish? What are the "big things" you need to complete? Then, break those down into smaller pieces. When you have broken the project down into clear and achievable tasks, make a timeline for yourself that will allow you to finish on time. Does it seem unreasonable? Consider scaling your project back in order to make it achievable!

You will submit a draft of your decomposition and timeline early in the project. Since things will change as you work on your game/tool/etc, you will update your timeline and submit a final version at the end, showing the actual steps and timeline that you used to complete your project.

### Stage 2: Flow Chart

Your flow chart should show the logic flow for your game/tool. It should be clear and easy to follow and should show all steps the user may take in using your game/tool. You will submit a draft early in the process and a final version att the end.

### Stage 3: The Game (or tool)

Your game/tool/activity must contain a coding commponent. You may also have some physical components, such as a game board and playing pieces, if desired. 
* **Note for Spring 2020: Any physical components must be printable and able to be submitted on Canvas due to Distance Learning limitations.**

•	Game contains some code component
o	Code contains examples of variables, loops, conditionals, and functions
•	At least 1 function that actually does something useful (and it called at least 2-3 times in your code)
•	At least 3 variables
•	At least 1 for loop and at least 1 while loop
•	At least 1 conditional (if/else)
•	At least 1 input() and 1 print()
o	Comments/Text
•	You need to include useful comments so that we can understand your code
•	Game is applicable to a MS Focus Day
•	Game contains enough complexity to be engaging and educational
•	Game contains clear instructions/rules for play
•	All unique materials needed for game play are included
o	Standard stationary materials (pens, paper, etc) need not be included


•	Draft due prior to due date
•	Final version due with project (should include any changes that happened along the way)
•	Should be clear to clear and easy to follow
•	Should show all steps, including loops, conditionals, functions
•	Neatness counts!
 


Be sure to include instructions for how to play the game, either in your code or attached to a game board, etc. Also, be sure to note (clearly) what focus game your game is meant to help. 

Don't forget references - for both content and code assistance!
Your program must contain the following components:
* 



Decomposition - 2 versions (15)
•	Initial draft due early in the project
•	Diagram clearly shows how problem was broken down into more manageable parts (and sub-parts)
•	Include a schedule for project completion. 
o	This should very clearly include due dates for the various components you are making.
•	Final version due with project. (This should include any changes that happened along the way.)
